# list-keeper

list-keeper is a simple front-end application to store and manipulate lists. Hit enter to submit a text or search field, and use the buttons to navigate and move lists around.

This approach stores lists in JSON format in AppComponent and uses event emitters from the child ListComponents to manipulate them. 

## Build and deploy for testing (Angular)

To run, make sure to first install Angular 2+.

From the parent directory, run `ng build` to build the project. Then, run `ng serve` to test on a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in a browser of your choice. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Compatibility

Tested with up-to-date versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
